## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the Cloud Resume Challenge, which I came across from in a YouTube video. The challenge is for people who are looking to create their own beginner-friendly cloud project by following some steps.  Here is a link for those who may be interested: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/  I decided to go beyond the original challenge by:

- Using React for a modern and dynamic user experience.
- Incorporating Material UI to streamline the design process with pre-built components.
- Automating deployment with GitHub Actions to implement CI/CD best practices.

Building this project allowed me to combine my knowledge of front-end development with cloud technologies.
